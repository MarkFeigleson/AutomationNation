Basic tools to assist in factory work accountability

This is my, Mark Feigleson's, first attempt at a project in Python that is for productivity assistance more so than fun or just exercise.

The initial draft was made in my spare time while working in the injection mold department of my factory.

At work I must grab a total count of parts from a machine every hour. The total number is divided by 2 because there are left hand and right hand parts.
In addition, I must report the kind of scrap that occured, if it occured, and the amount of downtime.

While the basic program needs some polish to allow the user to choose the amount of hours they wish to account for, other features I wish to include are a downtime tracker and the ability to announce the category of scrap and account for it.

For example, if I have 3 left hand pieces of scrap from scratches, then 2 right hand pieces from foreign material, I want to be able to allow the user to add those categories and fast select them.
